Chat Transcript: Rhythm Game Powerup Analyzer MVP

1. User: I'd like to build something fun. There's this rhythm game that has an activatable powerup which doubles your points earned for five seconds. I'd like to build an app to scrape data from the game visuals and optimize when to use the powerup. I'm thinking for competitive players or streamers to get the maximum possible scores. The game is on PC, so my initial thought is my app runs on the same device and captures the screen. I think some kind of visualisation would be cool - like a density graph of points over time.

2. Copilot: Oh wow, this is an electrifying idea! ... [asks clarifying questions and sketches a workflow]

3. User: The game is called rift of the necrodancer - it has the score, number of hits and beat number on screen. My idea is 1. start the app 2. start the song in rift (the game will play itself for testing) - wait for song to complete 3. the app produces a report and gives a beat number for the best time to have activated the powerup. The data scraping will be simple OCR for numbers in fixed places on the screen. I'm not sure how much scope is reasonable, so for an MVP I'd like to start by determining the highest density point zones. My idea is that to start with I'd be the only person using the app, and I would get beat numbers which I could then share with people going for high scores.

4. Copilot: This is shaping up to be a seriously cool “score science” tool ... [summarizes MVP and asks about visualization and output]

5. User: The density graph should be a simple line graph with beat on the x axis and points on the y axis, I would like to highlight the top 3 non-overlapping regions of 5 seconds (separate to beats). For MVP lets make the output a window with logging as a csv file (i.e. the raw data collected should be stored). I am happy with results after the song.

6. Copilot: OK! We’ve got enough to build a specification and get started! ... [summarizes MVP spec and next steps]

7. User: I'm most familiar with python. What's your take on the spec and what tech stack would you recommend?

8. Copilot: Great, you’ve got a clear, focused spec and Python experience—this is a strong foundation ... [reviews spec, recommends stack, and highlights challenges]

9. User: OCR reliability - some of the text is slanted and there's backgrounds which might need filtering out

10. Copilot: Excellent, you’re already thinking about the real-world OCR pain points ... [outlines OCR challenges and mitigation strategies]

11. User: Let's include a calibration tool as the first task. What tools would I use?

12. Copilot: Great decision! Including a calibration tool up front will save you a ton of pain ... [recommends OpenCV, selectROI, config, etc.]

13. User: For the MVP I'd like to use openCV so it's simple over pretty. Let's go with this idea and the suggested stacks

14. Copilot: That’s a solid, pragmatic choice! ... [confirms OpenCV approach and asks about code structure]

15. User: SpecPurpose: the application I defined earlier in this chat.

16. Copilot: [Creates structured specification file in /spec/spec-design-rhythm-game-powerup-analyzer.md]

17. User: PlanPurpose: the implementation plan to build the app defined in specification #file:spec-design-rhythm-game-powerup-analyzer.md step-by-step

18. Copilot: [Creates implementation plan in /plan/feature-rhythm-game-powerup-analyzer-1.md]

19. User: Create a text file in #file:spec that contains the entire chat so far
